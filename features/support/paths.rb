  # Maps a static name to a static route.
  #
  # This method is *not* designed to map from a dynamic name to a 
  # dynamic route like <tt>post_comments_path(post)</tt>. For dynamic 
  # routes like this you should *not* rely on #path_to, but write 
  # your own step definitions instead. Example:
  #
  #   Given /I am on the comments page for the "(.+)" post/ |name|
  #     post = Post.find_by_name(name)
  #     visit post_comments_path(post)
  #   end
  #

      root_path
    
		when /the account page/i
			account_path
		
		when /the start page/
			root_path
		
		when /the blog page/
			weblog_path
		
		when /the service page/
			service_path

    when /the lectures page/
			lectures_path
			
    # Add more page name => path mappings here

This plugin extends the functionality of will_paginate.

It adds the following features:

1 - Support for rendering the last page.
  Example:
    Product.paginate :page => :last, :per_page => 50


2 - No empty page unless all pages are empty
  If your set has 5 pages and you request page 6, will_paginate returns an empty page, causing
  the misleading impression that no records were found. This happens specially when the only
  record of the last page is deleted. This extension corrects it looking for not empty previous
  pages (although the url will still indicate the non-existing page).
